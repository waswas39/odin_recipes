        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>
            My secret ingredient makes this Japanese fried rice unlike 
            anything else I’ve ever done… but boy, is it good! Buttery, 
            garlicky, egg accents and that little something extra add up 
            to a great-tasting, standout rice dish.
        </p>
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Japanese short grain rice</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Japanese mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
            <li>2 tsp finely chopped parsley</li>
            <li>sea salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To cook the rice, place the rice in a sieve and rinse under running water. Then transfer the rice to a large bowl, 
                cover with water and soak for 30 minutes. Drain the rice very well before adding to a medium saucepan. Add 2¼ cups 
                of water. Cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Then reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 minutes. Keep the pot 
                covered but remove it from the heat. Allow to rest for 10 minutes to allow the residual steam and heat to continue 
                cooking the rice. Use a fork or wooden spoon to fluff up the rice.</li>
            <li>Transfer 2 heaped cups of rice to large bowl (save the rest in the fridge or another meal). While the rice is still 
                warm, mix through the mayonnaise.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a pan over medium-high heat. When the butter is melted, add the garlic and stir-fry for a minute. 
                Then add the rice and stir-fry for another half a minute. Then add the soy sauce and toss until well combined. Move 
                the rice to one side of the pan and add your eggs into the empty side. Allow to set for half a minute before 
                scrambling and mixing the egg into the rice.</li>
            <li>Taste and season with salt to taste. Toss through the parsley and serve.</li>
        </ol>
