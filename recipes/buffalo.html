        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chili powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>3 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>2 medium zucchini</li>
            <li>8 oz mushrooms</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>4 tbsp bufffalo sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook enough rice to yield 3 cups of cooked rice. 1 cup of dry rice will make around 2-3 cups of 
                cooked rice depending on what kind you use. </li>
            <li>In a large bowl add the chicken, a bit of oil, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat. </li>
            <li>You can cook your chicken however you like. I baked mine at 425Â°F for 10 minutes and then broiled it on the top rack for 
                5 minutes to develop color. Cut into 1 inch pieces. If you would rather pan fry it follow the instructions in the next step.</li>
            <li>Heat a grill pan or a skillet over medium high heat and add some oil. Cook the chicken thighs for 4-5 minutes on each side. 
                Cut them into a large dice and return to the pan to develop color.</li>
            <li>Wash and cut your zucchini into a small dice and mushrooms into a large dice. Cut the onion into a small dice. </li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add oil and saute the onions for a couple of minutes. </li>
            <li>Add a bit more oil and add in the mushrooms, season with salt to help bring out the water. Allow them to cook and develop color. </li>
            <li>Add in the zuchinni and cook until soft. </li>
            <li>Measure out 3 cups of cooked rice and add to a large bowl. Mix in the chicken, vegetables, cheese, and buffalo sauce. Season 
                with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>This recipe makes 5 servings. Divide your ingredients evenly 5 ways.</li>
